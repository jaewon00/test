참여 방법입니다.

This site showcases Java Design Patterns. The solutions have been developed by experienced programmers and architects from the open source community. The patterns can be browsed by their high level descriptions or by looking at their source code. The source code examples are well commented and can be thought as programming tutorials on how to implement a specific pattern. We use the most popular battle-proven open source Java technologies.
